# PerlAdminDashboard

A web application built in Perl using the Dancer2 micro-framework. The goal is to create a simple helpdesk for sysadmins and a dashboard for monitoring system resources.

The web app includes several functionalities:

1. **Authentication** - Users can access the application only after authentication.
2. **HelpDesk**
   - The main application provides an overview of requests that users can manage.
   - Requests are generated by reading emails from an inbox.
   - Request statuses include **New**, **In Progress**, and **Completed**.
3. **SystemMonitor**
   - The main application provides an overview of **monitored devices** and their resource usage, such as RAM usage, CPU, disk, network, power state (on/off), etc.
   - A new script will be created to run on each **monitored device**, sending continuous status updates about the device.
4. **PasswordGenerator**
   - A parameterized tool for generating passwords.
   - Parameters include: password length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters.

# PerlAdminDashboard

A web application built in Perl using the Dancer2 micro-framework. The goal is to create a simple helpdesk for sysadmins and a dashboard for monitoring system resources.

The web app includes several functionalities:

1. **Authentication** - Users can access the application only after authentication.
2. **HelpDesk**
   - The main application provides an overview of requests that users can manage.
   - Requests are generated by reading emails from an inbox.
   - Request statuses include **New**, **In Progress**, and **Completed**.
3. **SystemMonitor**
   - The main application provides an overview of **monitored devices** and their resource usage, such as RAM usage, CPU, disk, network, power state (on/off), etc.
   - A new script will be created to run on each **monitored device**, sending continuous status updates about the device.
4. **PasswordGenerator**
   - A parameterized tool for generating passwords.
   - Parameters include: password length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase letters.

## Sources

During the course I followed [Perl docs](https://www.perl.org/docs.html), [MetaCPAN - Dancer2 docs](https://metacpan.org/dist/Dancer2/view/lib/Dancer2/Manual.pod).  To better understand the Dancer2 application infrastructure, I also worked through the [CodeMaven - Dancer2 tutorial](https://slides.code-maven.com/dancer/dancer.html).

## App modules

### 1 Application

1. Create default template using CLI and `Dancer2`:

   ```bash
   dancer2 gen -a <AppName>
   
   # App structure is created:
   .
   ├── bin
   │   └── app.psgi # Application Entrypoint - startup file.
   ├── config.yml # Default configuration file.
   ├── cpanfile # This file is used to manage dependencies via CPAN.
   ├── environments # Environment specific files e.g. development/production.yml.
   ├── lib # Root directory of custom modules.
   │   └── Web.pm # Represents endpoints which are loaded using app.psgi.
   ├── Makefile.PL # This is a Perl module build file used to create a Makefile for your application.
   ├── MANIFEST # This file lists all the files that are part of the distribution.
   ├── MANIFEST.SKIP # This file specifies which files should be skipped when generating the MANIFEST. 
   ├── public # Static files which are accessible through HTTP for client
   │   ├── css
   │   ├── images
   │   └── javascripts
   ├── t #  This directory is for tests, which are essential for ensuring the application's functionality.
   │   ├── 001_base.t
   │   └── 002_index_route.t
   └── views # Frontend templates for data representation
       ├── index.tt
       └── layouts
           └── main.tt # A main layout template that other templates can extend.
   ```

2. Run application.

   ```bash
   plackup bin/app.psgi
   
   HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/
   127.0.0.1 - - [19/Oct/2024:14:26:52 +0200] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 23 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:128.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/128.0"
   ```

3. Automatic reloads on file save using `-r`.

   ```bash
   plackup -r bin/app.psgi
   ```

4. Throw reasonable-looking errors to the user instead of crashing the application. **- It is moved to configuration file.**

   - Set `show_stacktrace` in `app.psgi`

     ```perl
     # configurations
     set show_stacktrace => $ENV{DANCER_ENVIRONMENT};
     ```

   - Set environment on application start using

     ```bash
     DANCER_ENVIRONMENT=1 plackup bin/app.psgi
     DANCER_ENVIRONMENT=1 plackup -r bin/app.psgi
     ```

5. Set log level in `app.psgi` **- It is moved to configuration file.**

   ```perl
   set log => 'warning'; # set logging level
   ```

6. [Set application configuration](https://metacpan.org/dist/Dancer2/view/lib/Dancer2/Config.pod).

   - Default configuration file is located in **app root** `src/config.yml`. This file contains **default values**.
   - Environment specific files are located in `src/environment/{env}.yml`. These contains **environment specific values**.
   - New run application command:

   ```bash
   DANCER_ENVIRONMENT=development plackup -r bin/app.psgi
   ```

### 2 Authentication

#### 2.1 [Creating First Standalone Module](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/perl-modules/)

1. The module file is named `PasswordHasher` with the extension `.pm` (e.g., `PasswordHasher.pm`).

2. The module's first line contains the **package declaration** (`package services::crypto::PasswordHasher;`), and the package name should match the file name (without the `.pm` extension).

   - Package name mus follow folder structure.

   ```bash
   .
   ├── app.psgi
   ├── Services
   │   └── Crypto
   │   │   └── PasswordHasher.pm
   └── views
       └── index.tt
   ```

3. A package must always return a **true** value to indicate it was loaded successfully. Typically, this is done by returning `1` at the end of the file.

##### Exporting, Including and aliases

1. Export module subroutines

   ```perl
   use Exporter 'import'; # Import the Exporter module
   our @EXPORT_OK = qw(hashPassword verifyPassword); # Functions to export
   
   sub hashPassword {
       # feature implementation
   }
   
   sub verifyPassword {
       # feature implementation
   }
   
   1;
   ```

2. Including is done using `use` keyword and **namespace** follows `use Services::Crypto::PassworHasher;`.

   ```perl
   # option1
   use lib '.'; # since module is not located in default @NIC path then it's required to specify path
   use Services::Crypto::PasswordHasher;
   
   my $password = "password";
   my $hash = Services::Crypto::PasswordHasher::hashPassword($password);
   print "Hashed Password: $hash\n";
   
   # OR Option2
   use lib '.';
   use Services::Crypto::PasswordHasher qw/hashPassword verifyPassword/; # import methods
   
   my $hash = hashPassword($password);
   ```

#### 2.2 Create SQLite database and `users` table with default `Inbuilt` account.

```sql
-- in cli run script 
sqlite3 AdminDashboard.db
SQLite version 3.40.1 2022-12-28 14:03:47
Enter ".help" for usage hints.

sqlite>  -- run SQL scripts from database.sql file
sqlite> .exit -- exit
```
